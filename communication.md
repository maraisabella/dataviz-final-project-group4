# Description of the communication protocols:

- In order to enhance our communication in the most effective manner, we will be communicating via Slack for project updates.

- We will also be conductive team Zoom meetings every day.

- With both of these methods being used for our project, they are both equally crucial because we will be notifying each other of changes made to code and coordinating with each other before changes are pushed, pulled, and merged on GitHub.
