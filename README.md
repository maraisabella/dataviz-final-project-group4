# dataviz-final-project-group4
Final project for the McCombs Data and Visualization Bootcamp

## Project
### Topic: Prediction of early re-admission for hospitalized patients with diabetic care.
### Reason for topic selection:
Availability of clinical data containing valuable information.

### Description of the source of data: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/#supplementary-materials
### Questions hoping to be answered with the data: 
- To analyze the clinical data and predict early re-admission (within 30 days) of diabetic patients.

### Description of the communication protocols: 
In order to enhance our communication in the most effective manner, we will be communicating via Slack for project updates. We will also be conductive team Zoom meetings every day. With both of these methods being used for our project, they are both equally crucial because we will be notifying each other of changes made to code and coordinating with each other before changes are pushed, pulled, and merged on GitHub.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to implement end to end data pipeline and finally analyze and model the data using ML techniques.

### Exploratory Data Analysis


### Machine Learning Model
The provisional machine learning model we have used is Logistic Regression to predict patient re-admission based on the following features:

features = ['race',
 'gender',
 'age',
 'medical_specialty',
 'diag_1',
 'diag_2',
 'diag_3',
 'max_glu_serum',
 'A1Cresult',
 'metformin',
 'repaglinide',
 'nateglinide',
 'chlorpropamide',
 'glimepiride',
 'acetohexamide',
 'glipizide',
 'glyburide',
 'tolbutamide',
 'pioglitazone',
 'rosiglitazone',
 'acarbose',
 'miglitol',
 'troglitazone',
 'tolazamide',
 'examide',
 'citoglipton',
 'insulin',
 'glyburide-metformin',
 'glipizide-metformin',
 'glimepiride-pioglitazone',
 'metformin-rosiglitazone',
 'metformin-pioglitazone',
 'change',
 'diabetesMed']
